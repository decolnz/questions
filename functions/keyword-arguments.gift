::Keyword Arguments::What is true about Keyword Arguments in Python? {
=It does not matter what order you list the arguments when calling the function as 
long as you set the augumet equal to the argument name.
~You have to list the arguments in the function exactly the same way as the function was defined.
~To call the function, you only have to use the first three letters of the keyword argumet name, (Ex: Argumnet Name: user_name, Call Function: use="Bob").
~Just another word for arguments in a function.
